# Boxer Buddy

Boxer Buddy is an open source multiboxing application for old MMORPGs.

What is multiboxing?
Multiboxing is the act of playing multiple accounts of a single game at one time.

This project is a **work in progress** (alpha) and has minimal features.

## About

The goal of this project is to experiment with Go and React as a performant

between the backend and frontend is achieved via websockets.
